#Motivation

###Some facts about heart disease

* Approximately 1.5 million heart attacks and strokes occur every year in the United States.
* More than 800,000 people in the United States die from cardiovascular disease each year—that's 1 in every 3 deaths, and about 160,000 of them occur in people under age 65.
* Heart disease kills roughly the same number people in the United States each year as cancer, pneumonia, and accidents combined.
* Heart disease and stroke cost the nation an estimated $555 billion in health care costs and lost productivity in 2015.

####*Here is more:*

Majority of Americans are already suffering from heart disease:

And…

*About 90% of the risk for the first heart attack is because of conditions or lifestyle factors that are preventable*

There is plenty of room for improvement when it comes to raising awareness for cardiovascular risk, based on a [recent study] (https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/JAHA.117.005491) that found one in five adults at risk for heart disease don’t recognize a need to improve their health. We believe that a better understanding of risk factors underlying health perceptions and behaviors is needed to capitalize on cardiovascular preventive efforts.

###Goals of our project

* Understanding risk factors for heart disease and stroke
* Visualizing correlations of these risk factors with heart disease and stroke
* Visualizing the distribution of risk factors and cardiovascular outcomes in New York City
* Predicting risk of heart disease in an individual patient based on presence of risk factors
