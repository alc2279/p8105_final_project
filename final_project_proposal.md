## The tentative project title

Evaluating Risk Factors of Cardiovascular Mortality

## The motivation for this project

Heart disease is currently the leading cause of death in the US in both
men and women. While this is a disease that takes 1 in every 4 deaths,
80% of the cases are actually preventable. Education about lifestyle
choices (i.e.Â diet, exercise) and awareness around the impact that
lifestyle choices have on your health are essential in giving people the
power to make healthy choices.

A member of the team, Aakriti, is involved in a startup called
[Heartbeat](https://heartbeathealth.com/), which is clinic aimed at
providing cardiovascular screening and heart disease prevention
education, specifically in individuals who have the opportunity to
change their lifestyles in their 30s and 40s. Our goal is to provide
data-driven insights that can be used by the Heartbeat team and patients
about the risk factors of heart disease and their geo-spatial
distribution. Additionally, we aim to create an interactive
visualization tool that will enable people to understand the impact of
cardiovascular risk factors.

## The intended final products

  - Visualizations/statistical models showing associations between
    cardiovascular mortality and risk factors, including location
    specific (at the county level) visualizations
  - Interactive Shiny tool that will allow patients to input their data
    (observe changes in risk based on behavior/health changes)

## The anticipated data sources

  - [Risk Factors by County (2013
    to 2015)](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation?fbclid=IwAR1YHiMm53wKQCr3nE_AhvKumi_jpJvR_HUMkQVy8ZxZKnzT2AHPhE_IwYU)
  - [Mortality Rates by County (2013
    to 2015)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/heart-disease-mortality-data-among-us-adults-35-by-state-territory-and-county-5fb7c?fbclid=IwAR134ApPkx99gK3qvvfWoCBjUQA45aP_OB_Ht5s0amyfTrxPJFEu0XsXBpU)

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

  - Privacy issues with entering individual health data into shiny
  - Finding and implementing the right packages for the spatial data and
    framingham model
  - Learning shiny
  - The imcorporation of GIS data to visualize the county level risk and
    mortality.
